# Asimi CLI Project Context

Our mission is to have a tool that is safe, fun and produces high quality code

IMPORTANT: Keep the directory tree flat. Try and add your changes to existing files and if that does not makes sense - create as little new files as possible and always get your consent when creating directories and files

- to test: `just test` 
- to build:`just build`
- to update dependecies: `just modules`
- use present progressive in commit messages
