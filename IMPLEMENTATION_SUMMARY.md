# Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the three tasks from the CHANGELOG.md "To be Implemented" section.

## 1. Markdown Styling in Chat Window ✅

### What was implemented:
- Integrated the `glamour` library for markdown rendering
- AI messages now render markdown with proper formatting including:
  - **Bold** text
  - *Italic* text
  - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
  - Lists, headers, and other markdown elements
- User messages and system messages remain plain text for clarity
- Markdown renderer automatically adjusts to terminal width

### Files modified:
- `chat.go`: Added glamour import, markdown renderer field, and `renderMarkdown()` method
- `go.mod`: Added glamour dependency

### How it works:
- When AI messages are displayed, they are processed through the glamour renderer
- The renderer uses the terminal's auto-style to match the Terminal7 color scheme
- Fallback to plain text if rendering fails
- User messages are not markdown-rendered and are displayed as indented plain text for clarity

## 2. CTRL-Z Background Support ✅

### What was implemented:
- Added CTRL-Z key handler to suspend the application
- Displays a friendly message: "⏸️ Asimi will be running in the background now. Use `fg` to restore."
- Uses bubbletea's built-in `tea.Suspend` command for proper terminal handling

### Files modified:
- `tui.go`: Added CTRL-Z handler in `handleKeyMsg()` and new `handleCtrlZ()` function

### How it works:
- When user presses CTRL-Z, the application:
  1. Displays a message in the chat window
  2. Sends the `tea.Suspend` command
  3. The process is suspended and can be resumed with `fg` command

## 3. Vi Mode Support ✅

### What was implemented:
- Added `/vi` command to toggle vi mode
- When vi mode is enabled:
  - Command prefix changes from `/` to `:`
  - Prompt border color changes to yellow (#F4DB53) to indicate vi mode
  - All commands work with `:` prefix (e.g., `:help`, `:new`, `:quit`)
- Toast notification shows current mode status
- Command completion works with both `/` and `:` prefixes

### Files modified:
- `prompt.go`: Added `ViMode` field and `SetViMode()` method
- `commands.go`: Added `/vi` command and `handleViCommand()` handler
- `tui.go`: Added colon key handler and updated command processing logic

### How it works:
- User runs `/vi` command to toggle vi mode
- When enabled:
  - Prompt border changes color (visual indicator)
  - Colon key (`:`) triggers command completion
  - Command processing normalizes `:` to `/` internally
  - All existing commands work seamlessly
- User can toggle back to normal mode with `:vi` command

## Testing

All implementations:
- ✅ Compile successfully
- ✅ Pass all existing tests
- ✅ Follow the project's coding style
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility
- ✅ Use Terminal7 color scheme

## Dependencies Added

- `github.com/charmbracelet/glamour` - For markdown rendering

## Notes

- The markdown rendering is applied only to AI messages to maintain clarity
- Vi mode is a toggle, not a full vi emulation (just command prefix change)
- CTRL-Z uses the standard Unix suspend mechanism
- All features integrate seamlessly with existing functionality
